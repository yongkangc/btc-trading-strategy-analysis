## üìà Risk-Adjusted Performance (Sortino Ratio)

| Rank | Asset | Sortino Ratio | Rating |
|------|-------|---------------|--------|
| ü•á | **SOL** | **16.488** | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Exceptional |

## üîó Correlation Analysis

### Correlation Matrix
|      | ETH   | SOL   | HYPE  |
|------|-------|-------|-------|
| **ETH**  | 1.00 | **0.76** | 0.49 |
| **SOL**  | 0.76 | 1.00 | 0.46 |
| **HYPE** | 0.49 | 0.46 | 1.00 |

### Interpretation
- **1.0** = Perfect positive correlation (move together 100%)
- **0.0** = No correlation (independent)
- **-1.0** = Perfect negative correlation (move opposite)

### Key Findings
1. **ETH-SOL: 0.76 (High Correlation)**
   - Move together 76% of the time
   - Limited diversification benefit
   - Similar market drivers

2. **HYPE-ETH: 0.49 (Moderate Correlation)**
   - 51% independent price action
   - Good diversification opportunity

3. **HYPE-SOL: 0.46 (Moderate Correlation)**
   - 54% independent price action
   - Good diversification opportunity

### Key Takeaway
- **HYPE offers best diversification** (lowest correlation)
- ETH and SOL move together (limited diversification)
- Holding all three reduces portfolio volatility
