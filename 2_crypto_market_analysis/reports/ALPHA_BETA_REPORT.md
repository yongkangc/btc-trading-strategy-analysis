## Alpha/Beta Results

| Asset | Beta | Alpha (% annual) | RÂ² | Interpretation |
|-------|------|------------------|-----|----------------|
| ETH | 1.427 | 3.49 | 0.631 | High volatility, Matches BTC |

### What is Beta?

Beta measures an asset's sensitivity to BTC movements:
- **Beta > 1**: More volatile than BTC (amplifies moves)
- **Beta = 1**: Same volatility as BTC
- **Beta < 1**: Less volatile than BTC (dampens moves)

### What is Alpha?

Alpha measures excess returns beyond what beta predicts:
- **Positive Alpha**: Outperforms BTC (skill-based returns)
- **Zero Alpha**: Matches BTC performance
- **Negative Alpha**: Underperforms BTC

| Asset | Upside Capture | Downside Capture | Verdict |
|-------|----------------|------------------|---------|
| ETH | 133.5% | 131.5% | NO (amplifies both) |

- **Upside Capture < 100%**: Goes up LESS than BTC on up days
- **Downside Capture > 100%**: Goes down MORE than BTC on down days
- **Downside Capture < 100%**: Goes down LESS than BTC on down days

**Ideal defensive asset**: Upside > 100%, Downside < 100%

### Detailed Capture Analysis:

**ETH**:
- Upside Capture: 133.5%
  - Goes UP 33.5% MORE than BTC on up days
- Downside Capture: 131.5%
  - Goes DOWN 31.5% MORE than BTC on down days 

**SOL**:

### Special Analysis: SOL (2024-2025)

**Claim**: "SOL goes down less and goes up more than BTC"

**Verdict**: FALSE
- SOL goes up 50.4% MORE than BTC 
- BUT SOL also goes down 59.7% MORE than BTC 
- SOL amplifies BTC movements in BOTH directions (high beta = 1.58)

## Investment Implications

### Portfolio Construction

**For Maximum Returns**: HYPE
- Highest alpha (275.93% annually)
- Generates consistent excess returns beyond market (BTC)

**For Risk Management**: ETH
- Lowest beta (1.427)
- Less volatile than BTC, provides downside protection

### Risk/Return Tradeoff

```
ETH: Alpha/Beta ratio = 0.024
SOL: Alpha/Beta ratio = -0.161
HYPE: Alpha/Beta ratio = 1.796
```

Higher Alpha/Beta ratio = Better risk-adjusted returns

## Conclusion

### Key Takeaways:

1. **Beta Analysis**: All altcoins show positive beta, confirming they move with BTC
2. **Alpha Generation**: Positive alpha assets provide excess returns beyond market
3. **Diversification**: Lower beta assets reduce portfolio volatility
4. **Synchronization**: 70-80% same-direction movement suggests high market correlation

### Recommended Strategy:

- **Core holding (50%)**: BTC (market benchmark)
- **Alpha generator (30%)**: HYPE (highest excess returns)
- **Volatility reducer (20%)**: ETH (lowest beta)

This mix balances market exposure, alpha generation, and risk management.
