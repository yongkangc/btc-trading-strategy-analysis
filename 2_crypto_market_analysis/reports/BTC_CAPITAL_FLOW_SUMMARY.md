## Core Research Question

**"After BTC Dominance peaks/declines, where does capital flow to?"**

We tested two scenarios:
1. **Immediate correlation**: BTC <> ETH/SOL (no delay)
2. **Lagged correlation**: BTC <> ETH/SOL with 2-week, 1-month, 2-month delays

---

## KEY FINDINGS

### Finding #1: **ETH & SOL Move SIMULTANEOUSLY with BTC** ‚è±Ô∏è

**NO significant time lag detected**

| Correlation | No Delay | 2 Weeks Later | 1 Month Later | 2 Months Later |
|-------------|----------|---------------|---------------|----------------|
| **BTC ‚Üí ETH** | **77.2%** | 0.7% | 7.8% | -1.4% |
| **BTC ‚Üí SOL** | **75.3%** | -10.9% | 3.8% | 1.9% |

### Interpretation:
- **BTC-ETH move together 77.2% of the time** (STRONG correlation)
- **BTC-SOL move together 75.3% of the time** (STRONG correlation)
- **Time delays WEAKEN correlation** (drops to near-zero)
- **No exploitable lag pattern** for trading

### What This Means:
> **ETH and SOL react to BTC movements IMMEDIATELY (same day), not with a 2-week, 1-month, or 2-month delay.**
>
> This suggests the crypto market is highly efficient, with capital flowing to alts simultaneously with BTC moves, not in delayed waves.

## üí∞ Finding #2: **When BTC.D Drops, Capital Flows to ETH** üìà

### Performance When BTC Dominance DECLINES:

| Asset | Avg Daily Return | Performance vs BTC |
|-------|------------------|-------------------|
| **ETH** | **+6.77%** | **5.5x better than BTC** |
| **SOL** | **+4.86%** | **3.7x better than BTC** |
| **BTC** | **+1.30%** | Baseline |

### Key Insight:
> **When BTC.D drops (alt season signals), ETH outperforms BTC by 5.5x**
>
> This confirms the "alt season" thesis: when Bitcoin dominance declines, capital rotates to altcoins, especially ETH.

## üìâ BTC Dominance Statistics (1 Year)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Current BTC.D** | 96.26% |
| **1-Year Average** | 96.87% |
| **Maximum** | 98.08% (April 21, 2025) |

### Trend Analysis:
- **Declining days**: 162/364 (44.5%)
- **Rising days**: 202/364 (55.5%)
- **Current status**: BTC.D is **BELOW average** (96.26% vs 96.87%)

### Interpretation:
> **BTC.D is currently below average, suggesting capital is already flowing to alts**
>
> We are potentially in an "alt-friendly" environment right now.

## üîó Correlation Breakdown

### Immediate Correlation (No Delay):
```
         BTC       ETH       SOL
BTC   100.0%     77.2%     75.3%
ETH    77.2%    100.0%     75.1%
SOL    75.3%     75.1%    100.0%
```

### Lagged Correlation (BTC leads):

**After 2 Weeks (14 days):**
- BTC ‚Üí ETH: 0.7% (correlation destroyed)
- BTC ‚Üí SOL: -10.9% (negative correlation)

**After 1 Month (30 days):**
- BTC ‚Üí ETH: 7.8% (weak correlation)
- BTC ‚Üí SOL: 3.8% (weak correlation)

**After 2 Months (60 days):**
- BTC ‚Üí ETH: -1.4% (no correlation)
- BTC ‚Üí SOL: 1.9% (no correlation)

### Conclusion:
> **Time delays destroy the correlation**. ETH and SOL do NOT follow BTC with a lag; they move simultaneously.

## üí° Trading Implications

### What DOESN'T Work:

1. **Waiting for BTC to move, then buying ETH/SOL 2 weeks later**
   - Correlation: 0.7% to 7.8% (too weak)
   - No predictive power

2. **Using BTC movements to predict ETH/SOL 1-2 months later**
   - Correlation: -1.4% to 3.8% (essentially random)
   - Not exploitable

### What DOES Work:

1. **Buy ETH/SOL when BTC.D starts declining**
   - ETH outperforms BTC by 5.5x when BTC.D drops
   - SOL outperforms BTC by 3.7x when BTC.D drops

2. **Monitor BTC.D as a leading indicator**
   - Current BTC.D: 96.26% (below average)
   - When BTC.D peaks and reverses ‚Üí buy alts immediately
   - Don't wait for a lag; capital flows same-day

3. **Trade the immediate correlation**
   - BTC-ETH: 77.2% correlation (same-day moves)
   - BTC-SOL: 75.3% correlation (same-day moves)
   - Use BTC futures to hedge alt positions

## Answer to the Research Question

### **"Where does capital flow after BTC Dominance peaks?"**

### Answer:

**Capital flows to ETH and SOL IMMEDIATELY when BTC.D declines, NOT with a 2-week/1-month/2-month delay.**

### Detailed Breakdown:

1. **Timing**: Same-day capital rotation (77% correlation), not delayed
2. **Winner**: **ETH** (6.77% avg return when BTC.D drops)
3. **Runner-up**: **SOL** (4.86% avg return when BTC.D drops)
4. **BTC performance**: +1.30% (baseline when BTC.D drops)

### Why No Lag?

The crypto market is **highly efficient** and **globally traded 24/7**:
- Algorithmic trading bots react instantly
- Retail investors monitor BTC.D in real-time
- Capital flows are instant (no settlement delays)
- Social media spreads sentiment immediately

### Historical Context (3-Year Data):

From our earlier 3-year analysis:
- **SOL**: 901% annualized return, 16.5 Sortino ratio
- **ETH**: 317% annualized return, 6.4 Sortino ratio
- **Correlation**: ETH-SOL 76% (move together)

This suggests **diversifying between ETH and SOL** provides limited benefit, as they're highly correlated.

## üéì Methodology

### Test 1: Immediate Correlation
```python
returns = data.pct_change()
correlation = returns['BTC'].corr(returns['ETH'])
```

### Test 2: Lagged Correlation (BTC leads)
```python
# BTC movement today ‚Üí ETH movement X days later
lagged_corr = returns['BTC'].corr(returns['ETH'].shift(-lag))
```

### Test 3: Capital Flow Detection
```python
# When BTC.D drops by >0.1%
btc_dom_drops = btc_dom_change < -0.1
alt_returns = returns[btc_dom_drops]
```

## Actionable Recommendations

### For Traders:

1. **Monitor BTC.D in real-time**
   - Use TradingView: BTC.D chart
   - Set alerts for BTC.D < 96% (current: 96.26%)

2. **Buy alts when BTC.D starts declining**
   - Priority: ETH (6.77% avg outperformance)
   - Alternative: SOL (4.86% avg outperformance)

3. **Don't wait for a lag**
   - React same-day when BTC.D peaks
   - Waiting 2 weeks ‚Üí miss 99% of correlation

4. **Use BTC as a hedge**
   - 77% correlation ‚Üí BTC futures hedge alt positions
   - Long ETH/SOL + Short BTC = delta-neutral

### For Investors:

1. **Diversify with ETH & SOL**
   - Both outperform BTC in alt seasons
   - 75% correlation ‚Üí limited diversification

2. **Track BTC.D cycles**
   - 1-year range: 95.79% - 98.08%
   - Buy alts when BTC.D > 97.5%
   - Rotate to BTC when BTC.D < 96%

3. **Long-term hold strategy**
   - ETH: 317% annualized (3-year)
   - SOL: 901% annualized (3-year)
   - Both beat BTC in bull markets

---

## Limitations

1. **Sample Size**: 1 year (364 days)
   - May not capture full market cycles
   - Includes recent bull market (2024-2025)

2. **BTC.D Proxy**: Simplified calculation
   - Real BTC.D includes all altcoins
   - Our proxy: BTC / (BTC + ETH + SOL) only

3. **Market Efficiency**: High correlation suggests:
   - Limited arbitrage opportunities
   - Fast capital flows

4. **Changing Dynamics**: Crypto evolves rapidly
   - New catalysts (ETF approvals, regulations)
   - Correlation may change in future
