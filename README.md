## Overview

This project compares the performance of popular Bitcoin trading strategies over a 5-year period (2020-2025) using real historical data from Yahoo Finance. Tests both passive (HODL, DCA) and active strategies (technical indicators, dip buying) to determine which approach yields the best risk-adjusted returns.

### Data Source Confirmation
- **Source**: Yahoo Finance (YFinance API)
- **Ticker**: BTC-USD
- **Data Points**: 2,103 days
- **Date Range**: 2020-01-01 to 2025-10-04
- **Price Range**: $7,200 â†’ $122,380
- **HODL Return**: 1,599% (verified live data)

## Strategies Tested

### 1. HODL (Baseline)
Buy once at the start and hold without trading. The simplest passive strategy.

### 2. Buy the Dip
Buy when price drops a specific percentage from recent all-time high:
- **10% Dip**: Buy when price is down 10%
- **20% Dip**: Buy when price is down 20%
- **30% Dip**: Buy when price is down 30% (WINNER)

Uses 10% of capital per dip signal (max 10 trades).

### 3. RSI Oversold
Buy when Relative Strength Index (RSI) drops below 30, indicating oversold conditions. Classic momentum indicator widely used in technical analysis.

### 4. Moving Average Crossover (Golden Cross)
- **Buy**: When 50-day MA crosses above 200-day MA
- **Sell**: When 50-day MA crosses below 200-day MA (convert to cash)

Traditional trend-following strategy. Sells during bear markets and rebuy during bull markets.

### 5. Bollinger Bands
Buy when price touches the lower Bollinger Band (mean - 2 standard deviations). Mean reversion strategy that capitalizes on price extremes.

### 6. Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA)
- **Standard DCA**: Buy every 30 days with equal amounts
- **Volatility-Adjusted DCA**: Buy more when volatility is high (0.5x-2x multiplier)

Reduces timing risk through systematic accumulation.
