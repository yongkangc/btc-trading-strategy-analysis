## Deep Dive: Year-by-Year Analysis

![Yearly Charts](yearly_charts_screenshot.png)

### 2020: COVID Crash Recovery (Best: Buy Dip 30%, 428.7%)

**Market Context**: Bitcoin crashed from $7,200 to $4,970 in March 2020, then surged to $29,000 by year-end.

**Why Buy Dip 30% Won**:
- COVID crash triggered massive -30% dips from highs
- 10 perfectly-timed buys at rock-bottom prices
- Zero selling = captured full recovery

**HODL Performance**: 302.8% (still excellent, but missed additional dip opportunities)

---

### 2021: Bull Market Grind (Best: HODL, 57.6%)

**Market Context**: Steady bull market from $29,374 to $67,567, with no severe crashes.

**Why HODL Won**:
- No major -30% dips occurred
- Buy Dip 30% strategies ran out of opportunities
- Steady holding captured the full uptrend

**Lesson**: In smooth bull markets with no major corrections, simple HODL is unbeatable.

---

### 2022: Bear Market Survival (Best: MA Cross 50/200, 0.0%)

**Market Context**: Brutal bear market, BTC dropped from $47,687 to $15,787 (-67%).

**Why MA Cross Won**:
- Death Cross (50MA < 200MA) triggered sell signal early
- Converted to cash, avoided the -65% HODL loss
- Only strategy that didn't lose money

**Critical Insight**: This is the ONLY year where an active trading strategy beat HODL. In bear markets, having a sell mechanism can save capital.

**All Other Strategies**: Lost 30-65% due to holding through the crash.

---

### 2023: Recovery Rally (Best: HODL, 154.2%)

**Market Context**: Strong recovery from $16,625 to $44,167.

**Why HODL Won**:
- Clean recovery with no major dips
- Buy Dip strategies missed opportunities (no -30% crashes)
- RSI <30 caught some oversold bounces (88.5%)

---

### 2024: Volatile Bull Market (Best: Buy Dip 10%, 128.3%)

**Market Context**: Choppy uptrend from $39,507 to $106,141, with frequent pullbacks.

**Why Buy Dip 10% Won**:
- Multiple smaller -10% dips occurred
- More frequent buying opportunities than -30% strategy
- HODL still strong (111.5%) but Buy Dip 10% edged it out

---

### 2025 (YTD): Continued Growth (Best: Buy Dip 20%, 45.6%)

**Market Context**: Partial year data, $76,272 to $123,344.

**Why Buy Dip 20% Won**:
- Moderate dips allowed strategic accumulation
- HODL underperformed at 27.8%

---

## Critical Insights

### 1. HODL is the Overall Champion (98.1% avg)

Despite losing in individual years (2020, 2024, 2025), HODL's consistency across all market conditions makes it the long-term winner.

**Why HODL Works**:
- No timing required
- No missed opportunities
- Survives all market conditions
- Only lost significantly in 2022 bear market (-65%)

---

### 2. Buy the Dip Strategies Are Market-Dependent

**When They Win**:
- **2020**: -30% dip buying crushed it (428%)
- **2024**: -10% dip buying worked best (128%)

**When They Fail**:
- **2021**: No dips = no opportunities
- **2023**: Smooth recovery = missed gains
- **2022**: Holding through bear market = big losses

**Lesson**: Dip buying works in volatile markets with sharp pullbacks, but fails in smooth trends.

---

### 3. The 2022 Bear Market Exception

MA Cross 50/200 is the ONLY strategy that survived 2022 with 0% loss vs HODL's -65%.

**Implication**: For risk-averse investors, a sell mechanism can prevent catastrophic bear market losses. However, it comes at the cost of underperforming in bull markets (40% avg vs HODL's 98%).

**Trade-off**:
- **MA Cross 50/200**: 40% avg return, but protected capital in 2022
- **HODL**: 98% avg return, but suffered -65% in 2022

---

### 4. Sell Rules Are Wealth Destroyers

Every single sell rule variant underperformed:

- **Buy Dip 30% (no sell)**: 67.2% avg
- **Buy Dip 30% (profit_25)**: 13.0% avg (-81% worse)
- **Buy Dip 30% (sma_50)**: 2.6% avg (-96% worse)

**Why They Failed**:
- Sold too early in bull markets (2020, 2021, 2023, 2024)
- Missed compounding gains
- Excessive trading (77-1,242 trades vs 10 for buy-only)

**Lesson**: In Bitcoin's long-term bull trend (2020-2025), selling winners early is the enemy of wealth.

---

### 5. DCA is Consistent but Underperforms

**DCA 30d**: 49% avg return
- Pro: Never loses catastrophically
- Pro: Low risk (-37% max loss in 2022 vs -65% HODL)
- Con: Misses explosive gains in volatile years

**Lesson**: DCA is for risk-averse investors who prioritize consistency over maximum returns.

---
